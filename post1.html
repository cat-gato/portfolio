                            I been playing a new game here and there for the past month
                            called Dinkum and here is what I've been working on.
                            <br>
                            Dinkum is similar to Stardew Valley, a cozy farming game.
                            But Dinkum's setting is Australia and has broader focus then just farming.
                            <br>
                            For the first week or so I spent my time mainly just playing
                            the game and trying to unlock everything I possibly could.
                            But then I started working on building a bridge and decorating
                            my world! Here's some pictures of the bridge I was working on.
